Flickr Image Search Assignment - iOS
Write a mobile iOS app that uses Flickr image search API and displays result in a 2-Column scrollable view in
Portrait and 3-Column in Landscape mode.
Requirements:
* Support endless scrolling and load next set of images when the user scrolls to the bottom of the view.
* Should show a history of past searches.
* Clean and Neat User Interface.
Note:
* You are allowed to use any open-source third party frameworks you are comfortable with.
* Shortcuts are fine given the time constraint, but be prepared to explain better solutions you would have
implemented with more time.
* You are allowed to take a maximum of 4 days to finish this assignment.
* Do not try to implement features which are not asked for.
